I completed this project as a part of my Metis Data Science Bootcamp in the second week of January. But, now as a part of my relearning experience, I am looking back to see how I could have done things differently, with all that I have learned from my bootcamp as well as from my friends, since then. In this process, I have captured the best EDA techniques and the best practices of coding that I missed initially.

I hope you enjoy going through the project, as much as i did doing it. 
Have Fun,
