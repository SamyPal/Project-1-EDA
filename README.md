I completed this project as a part of my Metis Data Science Bootcamp in the second week of January. I also wrote a blog about the results of the project on my Github page here. But, now as a part of my relearning experience, I am looking back to see how I could have done things differently, with all that I have learned from my bootcamp as well as from my friends, since then. In this process, I also hope to capture EDA techniques and the best practices of coding that I may have missed initially.

I hope you enjoy going through the project, as much as i did doing it. Have Fun,
